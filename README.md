# go-wasm-template

This template lets you start building your Go+WASM app from a sample that works.

It features julienschmidt/httprouter and go/html/templates. 

I wrote run-scripts because a few commands need to be runned before actually running the main.go file.

Feel free to use, modify or share any of its content.

Please note that scripts were designed for storing the whole project in $GOPATH/src/go-wasm-template. You will need to adapt these if you wish to store the project anywhere else.
